/*
	This I'm guessing will become redundant if HMRC move to creating TaaS (Template as a Service)
	and include the div#global-header-bar in the template (which they should)

	But currently HMRC AF has this code to style the div
	https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/blob/master/assets/govuk_elements/govuk/public/stylesheets/govuk-template.css#L480
	Which refers to this code
	https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/blob/master/assets/govuk_elements/govuk/views/govuk_template.html#L98
	and I doubt if I were to create a PR to merge this into HMRC AF it wouldn't get merged for fear of possible consequences
