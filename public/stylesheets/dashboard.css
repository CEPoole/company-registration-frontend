/* 

The dashboard in unique and is not shared with other services apart from VAT registration and PAYE registration.
So this code and styles do not need to be shared and therefore will not make it into HMRC AF

Also, the dashboard may be a temporary feature (moving or being deleted in 2019).
So I have made the decision to host the css here in a separate file so that it is self contained
and easy to remove when required at a later date.
